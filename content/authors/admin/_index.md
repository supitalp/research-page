I am a Senior Research Scientist at Google Zurich, where I work on applied Computer Vision and Machine Learning together with [Federico Tombari](https://federicotombari.github.io/). My work has been focusing on semantic scene understanding (now serving millions of users daily through Google Lens) and more recently, generative AI.

Before that, I did my PhD at the [Robotics and Perception Group](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/) directed by [Davide Scaramuzza](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html) (ETH Zürich / University of Zürich), where I pioneered the use of [event cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_camera) for [SLAM](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/ultimateslam.html), [3D reconstruction](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/IJCV17_Rebecq.pdf), [robotics](https://fpv.ifi.uzh.ch/) and [high-speed video reconstruction](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/E2VID.html). I have graduated from [Télécom ParisTech](https://www.telecom-paris.fr) and [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en), through the [MVA M.Sc.](https://www.master-mva.com/).
